This is my lovely cat: Haha Zhao. She is a friendly, brave and active kitty. I adopted her on Aug 2nd 2025 in the [Capital Area Humane Society](https://adoptlansing.org/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=10819024466&gbraid=0AAAAACei5tMBOIURUbGo9_kwkD4KCCAz_&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4uWNiO33kQMVJ0b_AR2c2wNbEAAYASAAEgLCMPD_BwE)
